# Python OOP Assignment

## Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class
- *Smartphone class* → attributes: brand, model; method: call()
- *SmartphoneWithCamera class* → inherits from Smartphone; adds attribute camera_megapixels and method take_photo()

## Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge
- Base class Vehicle with method move()
- Subclasses:
  - Car.move() → prints "Driving 🚗"
  - Plane.move() → prints "Flying ✈️"

## Running
```bash
python classes.py
